-Wanted to make a pivot(peterbone) clone for linux using python;
-Am not sure how to proceed - will wing it;
-Here goes nothing

-Success!
-Succeded in creating a bone class(and various others) and implementing
 simple bone rotation.

-Will add creation of central(i.e. translatable) bone
-Will add methods for creationg of (parent, child) bone pairs

-Once again, success!!
-Succeded in adding central bone
-Succeded in adding parenting to bones
-Succeded in propagating rotation and translation to all child bones
 and also their children

-Will add method to add child bone to translator bone of chief bone
-Will add other things too

Entry 4

20:17 GMT+0545

-Succeded in adding "wunderkind" bones that can be connected to 
 the translator of a chief bone
-Added a mutex(select_mutex) that prevents the grabbing of more than one
 point(handler or translator) at a time.

-First and foremost, need to add way to create actual images out of the poses
 made by the bones
-After that, need to add windows to display frames
-Need to add method to play animation

Entry 5

-Added Frame objects to store different animation frames
-Removed children_list attributes as the references made copy.deepcopy cause
 a segfault
-The code is now slightly uglier due to various conditional statements resulting
 from the removal of children_list; Each bone now looks to its parent bone
 for cues to rotate or translate

 -Need to add a way to convert .jpegs to .gifs

-Am in Dhangadhi now

-Added CircleBone class
-Changed bg colour to white

-Need to take a look at accuracy during calculations; independent rotation of CircleBone objects
 shows noticeable movement of the centre of the cicrcle - need to fix this, but it shouldn't be much
 of a problem as CircleBone objects are not currently allowed to be a ChiefBone
-Still need to add .jpeg to .gif conversion

Entry 07

15:54 GMT+0545

-Still in Dhangadhi

-Added onionskin; variable onion_frame is assigned a value on saving a frame
 i.e. when frame_snap_mode is set to True

-Need to find a way to save animations as pivotix-editable files with an ex-
 tension such as .ptux(portmanteau of pivot + tux); cPickle cannot pickle 
 Surface objects
-Still need to find a way to create gifs from a group of jpegs

________
Entry 08
2016-10-11 TUE

-Still in Dhangadhi

-Added basic mechanism for saving and loading frame_lists (essentially an ani-
 mation) using cPickle; Had to change __init__ methods of all classes and 
 remove the self.mainS attribute for successful pickling

-Will add a way to edit frames and to select arbitrary frames and set cur_frame
 to that value
-Will add a way to remove and un-parent bones

Q to toggle parent-child pairing mode
To parent, toggle the PC-pairing mode on; first, click on the
pivot point of the child bone and then click on the handle of the
parent bone.
To make a 'wunderkind' bone, instead of the handle(red) of the chief bone,
the second point should be the tranlsator(yellow).

A to add a new bone
D to add a new circle

The pivot point of a bone is at the end opposite the handle.
This applies for circles too

W and E to load previous and next frames

F to snap a frame

KATHMANDU, NEPAL

-Successfully added jumping, falling, and punching
-handled error with left-punching using a hackish(blasphemy!) solution
 that involves moving the rectangle during the punch. Variables called
 self.a_mutex and self.fin were used to obtain the required behaviour.
 Have left #WARNING tokens in places. Need to remember to check them
 later
 -Need to add kunai-throwing and jutsus (including shunshin)

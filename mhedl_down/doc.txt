The gist of it is that mangahere stores images in <img> tags, which have the attr. onload="loadImg(this)".
Exploiting this, we can parse the html file for this pattern and get the direct link.

The program takes the manga's name, as it appears in the mangahere.co link e.g. for mangahere.co/manga/et_cetera, you
send et_cetera as the name.

Then, it downloads the html file and gets all teh chapter links.
It checks the format - /vxx/cxx.xx or /cxx.xx and creates folders accordingly
It downloads images using the request library.
